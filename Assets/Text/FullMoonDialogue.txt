ALFIE:
It's time!  
I can't believe it, my first day out of the village.  I'll show
those monsters what for.

The gate to the forest is to the north... here we go!

=================================
ALFIE wakes up in his house.

ALFIE:
Wha-??  Just a dream...
Heh, I guess I'm just too excited!
Wait... my ears...
What's going on?!?

DOWNSTAIRS, MOM:
A-Alfie, h-h-help me, please!
I don't know what's going on... but I don't feel so good...
Go find the elder next door, I'm sure he will know what to do.

OUTSIDE, ELDER:
Hmm... yes...
I have no idea what has happened here.
Hey, just because I'm the village elder doesn't mean I know everything!

But Alfie... you still seem to be mostly human.
I sense we only have a little time left before we become entirely animal.

Please... I know it's a lot to ask, but could you see if you can
find the truth?  Whatever did this must be nearby... in... the woods...

==================================
WOLF TOWN BOY:
This is terrible... everything's... going dark...

WOLF TOWN GIRL:
*snarl*

WOLF OLD LADY:
I'm scared, Alfie...

WOLF NERD:
Everything hurts... AARGH!

===================================
GUARD 1:
Hurry Alfie, head west out the gate to find the key into the mountains!
The elder hid it through the hedge maze.
You're the only one who can save us now...

===================================
INT MOUNTAIN -

ALFIE:
AAAAGH!  My... my hands!
Claws... I think I can fight back now?

*Press Space to strike with your claws*

AFTER 1 KEY -

ALFIE:
One key down!  But I think there might be another one somewhere.

AFTER 2 KEY - 

ALFIE:
Both keys!  The gates are on the east side.
But... how do I know?

======================================
INT CAVE - 

ALFIE:
What's this feeling...?
Something's calling to me.
...
I need to hurry.

UP LADDER -

ALFIE:
Another gate across the bridge to my right.
More keys somewhere?
